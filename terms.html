Any disputes shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in New York. You waive any objection to venue in these courts.

                <p>Before filing a claim, you agree to attempt informal resolution by contacting us. Any claim must be brought within one year of the event giving rise to the claim. Claims shall be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in court. Arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator in New York. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding. Class actions and representative actions are not permitted. Each party will bear their own arbitration costs. This section does not prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief.</p>

                <p>We shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations under these terms if such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to, mechanical, electronic, or communications failure or degradation. This includes natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, or government actions. In the event of a force majeure, we will make reasonable efforts to resume performance as soon as possible. You agree that we are not liable for any delays or failures in performance caused by such events.</p>

                <p>We may assign our rights and obligations under these terms at any time without notice to you. You may not assign your rights or obligations under these terms without our prior written consent. Any attempted assignment in violation of this provision is null and void. These terms will bind and benefit the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. We may also subcontract our obligations under these terms to third parties.

                <p>If any provision of these terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. The invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable. This ensures that the intent of the parties is preserved. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision to be invalid, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace it with a valid provision that reflects the original intent. The invalidity of one provision does not affect the validity of the remaining provisions.</p>

                <p>The failure of either party to enforce any right or provision of these terms shall not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by the party granting the waiver. A waiver of any breach or default shall not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. We reserve the right to enforce these terms at any time, even if we have previously chosen not to enforce them. Waivers are not to be construed as a continuing waiver.</p>
