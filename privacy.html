                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">1. Information Collection</h3>
                <p>We collect various types of information when you interact with our services, including personal identification details (name, email, phone number), technical data (IP address, browser type), and usage information (pages visited, services accessed). This collection occurs through direct interactions when you register, automated technologies when you browse our site, and third-party sources like social media platforms. We only collect information necessary to provide our services and improve your experience. Collection methods include forms, cookies, and analytics tools. You have control over what information you choose to provide, though some data is essential for service functionality.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">2. Use of Personal Data</h3>
                <p>Your personal data is used to provide and personalize our services, process transactions, and communicate with you about your account or inquiries. We analyze usage patterns to improve website functionality and develop new features. Data helps us prevent fraud, enhance security, and comply with legal obligations. Marketing communications are only sent with your consent, which you can withdraw anytime. We may use aggregated data for research and business analysis. Personal data is never sold to third parties. All processing activities have a lawful basis under applicable data protection regulations.</p>

            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">3. Data Sharing Practices</h3>
                <p>We may share your information with trusted service providers who assist in our operations under strict confidentiality agreements. These include payment processors, hosting providers, and marketing platforms. Data may be disclosed when required by law or to protect our legal rights. In business transitions like mergers, customer information may be transferred as a business asset. We never share data with third parties for their independent marketing purposes without your explicit consent. International transfers comply with appropriate safeguards like standard contractual clauses. We maintain records of all data sharing activities.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">4. Data Security Measures</h3>
                <p>We implement robust security measures including encryption, firewalls, and access controls to protect your information. Regular security audits and vulnerability testing help maintain system integrity. Employee access is limited through role-based permissions and mandatory training. Physical security controls protect our servers and facilities. We use secure protocols for data transmission and store sensitive information in encrypted form. While we strive to protect your data, no internet transmission is completely secure. We have incident response plans to address potential breaches and will notify affected individuals when legally required.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">5. Data Retention Policy</h3>
                <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy unless a longer retention period is required by law. Retention periods vary based on data type and purpose. Transaction data is typically kept for 7 years for tax and accounting compliance. Inactive accounts may be deleted after 3 years of inactivity. You may request deletion of your data, which we will honor unless legal obligations require retention. Backups containing personal data are securely erased according to our retention schedule. We periodically review stored data to minimize unnecessary retention.</p>

            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">6. User Rights and Choices</h3>
                <p>You have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your personal data. Requests can be made through our contact form and will be processed within 30 days. You may object to certain processing activities like direct marketing. Data portability allows you to receive your information in a structured format. Withdrawing consent doesn't affect the lawfulness of prior processing. We don't use fully automated decision-making with legal effects. Some rights may be limited when they affect others' rights or our legal obligations. No fee is usually charged for exercising these rights.</p>

            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">7. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h3>
                <p>We use cookies and similar technologies to enhance functionality, analyze usage, and support marketing efforts. Essential cookies are necessary for core functionality and can't be disabled. Performance cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our site. Functionality cookies remember your preferences. Targeting cookies support personalized advertising. Most browsers allow you to manage cookie preferences through settings. Disabling cookies may affect website functionality. We honor Do Not Track signals when technically feasible. Third-party services like Google Analytics may set their own cookies according to their policies.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">8. Third-Party Links</h3>
                <p>Our website may contain links to third-party sites not governed by this policy. We aren't responsible for the privacy practices of external sites and recommend reviewing their policies. Links to social media platforms may result in data collection by those services. Embedded content like videos may include tracking technologies from providers. We vet third-party services for compliance with data protection standards but can't guarantee their practices. Sharing information through integrated services is at your own risk. We disclaim liability for third-party actions beyond our control.</p>

            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">9. Children's Privacy</h3>
                <p>Our services aren't directed at children under 16, and we don't knowingly collect their personal information without parental consent. Parents or guardians may contact us to review, delete, or restrict processing of a child's data. We take steps to verify age when appropriate. School-related services comply with applicable student privacy laws. If we discover accidental collection of children's data without proper consent, we'll delete it promptly. Educational resources for children don't include personal data collection beyond what's necessary for functionality. We support parental control tools and child online protection initiatives.</p>

            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">10. International Data Transfers</h3>
                <p>As a global service, your data may be transferred to and processed in countries outside your residence. We ensure such transfers comply with applicable laws through safeguards like adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses. International service providers are contractually obligated to protect your data. European Economic Area residents have specific rights under GDPR regarding cross-border transfers. You may request information about our transfer mechanisms. Processing locations are chosen to optimize service performance while maintaining security. We conduct transfer impact assessments for high-risk scenarios.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">11. California Privacy Rights</h3>
                <p>California residents have specific rights under CCPA, including rights to know, delete, and opt-out of sale of personal information. We don't sell personal data as defined by CCPA. You may designate an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf. We won't discriminate against you for exercising privacy rights. Requests can be submitted through our designated channels and will be verified before processing. Certain information may be exempt from disclosure under CCPA exceptions. We provide at least two methods for submitting requests, including a toll-free number for California residents.</p>

            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">12. GDPR Compliance</h3>
                <p>For EU residents, we comply with General Data Protection Regulation requirements. Our Data Protection Officer oversees compliance efforts. We maintain records of processing activities and conduct data protection impact assessments for high-risk processing. Data breaches affecting EU residents are reported to authorities within 72 hours when required. We've implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection by design and default. EU residents may lodge complaints with their national supervisory authority. Our legal basis for processing is transparently disclosed in this policy.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">13. Payment Information Security</h3>
                <p>Payment transactions are processed through PCI-DSS compliant third-party processors. We don't store full credit card numbers after transaction completion. Tokenization replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive equivalents. Payment pages use TLS encryption and are regularly tested for vulnerabilities. You should never send payment information through unsecured channels like email. Disputed transactions may require retaining limited payment data for resolution. We monitor payment systems for suspicious activity and may temporarily block transactions that appear fraudulent. Recurring payments require explicit authorization and provide cancellation options.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">14. Account Security Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>You're responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials. We recommend using strong, unique passwords and enabling two-factor authentication where available. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized account access. Shared computers should use private browsing modes and be logged out after sessions. We'll never ask for your password via email. Account activity monitoring helps detect suspicious behavior but isn't foolproof. You may be liable for unauthorized activities conducted through your account if negligence is proven. Regular password updates enhance security.</p>

            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">15. Marketing Communications</h3>
                <p>Marketing emails are only sent with your consent and include unsubscribe options in every message. Preference centers allow customization of communication types and frequencies. We may analyze engagement to improve content relevance. Third-party marketing platforms must comply with our privacy standards. Text message programs require explicit opt-in and provide STOP instructions. You may see targeted ads based on your interactions with our website through cookie-based retargeting. Social media advertising uses platform-specific controls for ad preferences. Transactional messages about your account aren't considered marketing.</p>

                <p>Content you post publicly may be viewed and collected by others. We moderate user content but can't guarantee complete removal of sensitive information. Consider carefully before sharing personal details in public forums. Copyrighted material shouldn't be posted without permission. We may retain removed content when necessary for legal compliance. Anonymized user content may be used for research or promotional purposes. You grant us license to display and distribute your submissions in connection with our services. False or misleading content may result in account termination.</p>

                <p>In events like mergers, acquisitions, or asset sales, customer information may be transferred as part of the transaction. We'll notify you if your data becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings may also result in data transfer to third parties. We ensure that any acquiring entity adheres to similar privacy standards. You will be informed of any significant changes to how your personal data is handled. We take steps to protect your information during such transitions, including contractual obligations for data protection. If you have concerns about your data in these scenarios, you may contact us for clarification. We strive to maintain transparency throughout any business changes that affect your data.</p>
