                <p>Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit websites. They are widely used to make websites work efficiently and provide information to site owners. Cookies typically don't contain much information beyond a unique identifier and some site-specific details. They cannot carry viruses or install malware on your device. Cookies may be either "persistent" (remaining on your device until deleted) or "session" (deleted when you close your browser). First-party cookies are set by the website you're visiting, while third-party cookies come from other domains. Modern websites use cookies for essential functions, performance tracking, and personalization.</p>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">2. Types of Cookies We Use</h3>
                <p>We use several types of cookies on our website to enhance your experience. Strictly necessary cookies are essential for website functionality and cannot be switched off. Performance cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our site. Functional cookies enable enhanced features like remembering your preferences. Targeting cookies are used to deliver relevant advertising and track effectiveness. Social media cookies allow sharing content on platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Analytics cookies help us improve our website by collecting anonymous usage data. Each type serves a specific purpose in making our website more useful and relevant to you.</p>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">3. Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
                <p>These essential cookies are required for the website to function properly and cannot be disabled. They include cookies that remember your login status and items in your shopping cart. Without these cookies, core features like secure areas and online payments wouldn't work. They don't collect personal information for marketing purposes. Typically, these cookies are session-based and expire when you close your browser. We use them to maintain user sessions and prevent security threats. Even if you reject other cookies, these will still be placed on your device as they're fundamental to website operation.</p>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">4. Performance Cookies</h3>
                <p>Performance cookies help us understand how visitors use our website. They collect anonymous information about pages visited and error messages encountered. This data helps us improve how our website works and measure advertising effectiveness. These cookies don't collect personally identifiable information. We use services like Google Analytics that employ these cookies to provide aggregated statistics. The information is used to identify areas needing improvement. You can opt out of these cookies through your browser settings, though this may affect some website functionality. These cookies help us maintain high service standards for all users.</p>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">5. Functional Cookies</h3>
                <p>Functional cookies enable enhanced features and personalization on our website. They remember your preferences like language selection and region settings. These cookies may also provide services you've requested like live chat support. The information collected is anonymized and doesn't track your browsing on other sites. Without these cookies, certain features would become unavailable or require resetting on each visit. They typically persist longer than session cookies to maintain your preferences across visits. You can block these cookies but may then experience reduced functionality during your visits.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">6. Targeting Cookies</h3>
                <p>Targeting cookies are used to deliver ads more relevant to you and your interests. They track visits to our website and pages you've visited. This information may be shared with third-party advertising networks. The cookies remember you've visited our website and this information is shared with other organizations. They help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. You can opt out of these cookies through our cookie consent tool. Note that opting out doesn't mean you'll see fewer ads, just less relevant ones. These cookies are typically placed by advertising networks with our permission.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">7. Social Media Cookies</h3>
                <p>Social media cookies allow you to share content on social networks like Facebook and Twitter. They track your browser across other sites and build a profile of your interests. This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites. The cookies are typically placed by third-party social media providers. We use them to measure the effectiveness of our social media campaigns. They also enable integration of social media features like "Like" buttons on our site. You can manage these cookies through your social media account settings. These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our social media content.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">8. First-Party vs Third-Party Cookies</h3>
                <p>First-party cookies are set by our website domain and can only be read by our site. They're generally used for functionality like remembering your preferences. Third-party cookies are set by domains other than ours, usually for advertising or analytics. These allow services like Facebook or Google to provide features across multiple sites. We carefully select third-party providers who respect user privacy. Some browsers block third-party cookies by default for enhanced privacy. Our cookie consent tool allows you to manage both types separately. We audit third-party cookies regularly to ensure they comply with our privacy standards.</p>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">9. Cookie Duration</h3>
                <p>Cookies have varying lifespans depending on their purpose. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain for a set period specified in the cookie file. Some may last only a few hours while others persist for years. Performance cookies typically have shorter durations than targeting cookies. We regularly review cookie expiration times to balance functionality with privacy. Essential cookies usually have the longest durations to maintain continuity of service. You can manually delete cookies through your browser settings at any time. Our cookie policy lists the specific duration for each cookie we use.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">10. Managing Cookies</h3>
                <p>You can control cookies through your browser settings and our consent tool. Most browsers allow you to block or delete cookies either globally or by site. Disabling cookies may prevent certain website features from working properly. Our cookie consent manager lets you toggle different cookie categories. Note that blocking cookies won't remove existing ones - you'll need to delete them separately. Mobile devices may require different settings to manage cookies. We recommend reviewing your browser's help section for specific instructions. Remember that cookie preferences are device-specific and must be set on each device you use.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">11. Browser-Specific Controls</h3>
                <p>Each browser handles cookie controls differently. Chrome users can access settings through the three-dot menu and Privacy section. Firefox offers detailed cookie management under Options > Privacy & Security. Safari provides cookie controls in Preferences > Privacy tab. Edge users can find settings under the three-dot menu > Settings > Cookies. Opera manages cookies through Settings > Privacy & Security. Most browsers allow you to create exceptions for specific sites. Private browsing modes typically block persistent cookies by default. Browser updates may change cookie management locations, so check current documentation for your version.</p>

                <p>Managing cookies on mobile devices requires different approaches. iOS users can block cookies in Settings > Safari > Privacy & Security. Android Chrome users can manage cookies through the app's Site settings. Some mobile browsers offer limited cookie controls compared to desktop versions. App-based browsers may not provide cookie management options. Clearing app data typically removes all cookies for that application. Third-party cookie blockers are available through app stores. Mobile operating system updates can affect how cookies are handled. We recommend reviewing your specific device's documentation for accurate instructions.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">13. Impact of Disabling Cookies</h3>
                <p>Blocking cookies may significantly affect your website experience. Essential functions like logging in or making purchases may not work. Personalization features including saved preferences will be unavailable. The website may appear less optimized for your device. Some content may not display correctly without certain cookies. You might need to repeatedly enter the same information. Performance tracking that helps us improve the site will be limited. Advertising will become less relevant though you may see more ads overall. We recommend allowing essential cookies for full functionality.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-green-700">14. Cookie Consent</h3>
                <p>We obtain consent for non-essential cookies through our cookie banner. The banner appears on your first visit and after clearing cookies. You can change your preferences at any time through our cookie settings. Consent is recorded for six months before requesting renewal. We don't load non-essential cookies until consent is given. Withdrawing consent removes existing cookies from those categories. Our system remembers your preferences to avoid repeated consent requests. Detailed information about each cookie category is provided in our settings panel.</p>
